# The Box Model
![Gallery Analogy for the Terminology](images/css-box-model.avif)

- The content may overflow out of the box.
- Usually the size refers to the content box by default (`box-sizing: content-box;`), unless it's set to `box-sizing: border-box;`
- Browsers have their own user agent stylesheets, but they can be reset with reset and normalizer css files with (arguably) more sensible defaults.
E.g. to use the `border-box` sizing model,
```css
html {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
*,
*::before,
*::after {
  box-sizing: inherit;
}

```
- Debugging tip: borders may affect the size of the box, so you could use `outline` instead -- takes the space of the margin, and does not affect the box size.
- The `display` type affects how box properties are respected:
  - `block` boxe uses all of the behaviors defined;
  - `inline` boxes use _some_ behaviors -- `width` and `height` are ignored; vertical padding/border/margin don't push away other contents; horizontal ones are respected;
  - `inline-block` works like `block`, but does not break into a new line.
- `Margin` values can be positive or negative; they may collapse by taking the max (if both positive), min (if both negative), or subtract (one of them negative), given additional margin collapsing rules.
